# Hey, I'm Nikhil Mishra 👋

🚀 **Data Scientist** who turns raw, messy data into clean, actionable insights.  
📊 Obsessed with building ML models that actually work in production — from forecasting demand to summarizing internet chaos.  
☁️ Living in the clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure) but keeping my feet in solid data engineering pipelines.  

I enjoy:
- 🧮 Finding patterns in chaos  
- 📈 Turning SQL queries into stories  
- 🛠️ Automating the boring stuff  
- ☕ Coffee-fueled debugging sessions  

**Fun facts:**
- My LSTM model once hit **92% precision** predicting inventory allocation  
- Built ETL pipelines that made data flow **40% faster** (and my team a lot happier)  
- I’ve saved companies *real money* — like **$500K in one project**  

If you like data, machine learning, or weird API projects — you’re in the right repo.
